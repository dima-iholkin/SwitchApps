# Pre-install instructions:

* **Windows 10 users** should download the standard `SwitchApps.msi` [installer](https://github.com/dima-iholkin/SwitchApps/releases/latest).  
The standard version **needs** <u>the apps on the Taskbar ungrouped</u> with [7+ Taskbar Tweaker](https://rammichael.com/7-taskbar-tweaker) or some other solution. More info at [Post-install instructions](/_docs/Post-Install.md).  

* **If you want to keep the apps on Taskbar grouped**, download the `SwitchApps_NoUngroupMod.msi` installer. This moded version always chooses the first app from the app group.  

* **Windows 11 users** seem not able to easily ungroup the apps on the Taskbar anyway, so should download the `SwitchApps_NoUngroupMod.msi` installer. This moded version always chooses the first app from the app group.  

No worries, you can try another installation later.
