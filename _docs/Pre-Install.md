# Pre-install instructions:

* **Windows 10 users** should download the normal `SwitchApps.msi` [installer](https://github.com/dima-iholkin/SwitchApps/releases/latest).  
The normal version **needs** the apps on the Taskbar <u>ungrouped</u> with [7+ Taskbar Tweaker](https://rammichael.com/7-taskbar-tweaker) or some other solution. More info at [Post-install instructions](/_docs/Post-Install.md).  

* **If you want to keep the apps on Taskbar grouped**, download the `SwitchApps_NoUngroupMod.msi` installer. This mod always chooses the first app from the app group.  

* **Windows 11 users** seem not able to ungroup the Taskbar apps, so should download the `SwitchApps_NoUngroupMod.msi` installer. This mod always chooses the first app from the app group.  

No worries, you can try another installion later.
