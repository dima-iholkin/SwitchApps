# Pre-install instructions:

* Normally please choose to download the normal installer `SwitchApps.msi`.
* If you prefer to group apps on the Taskbar or cannot change this behavior of Windows, please choose the `SwitchApps-NoUngroupMod.msi`. This moded version will always choose the first window from any group.  
![Choose the first window from any group](/docs/_assets/03_NoUngroup.png?raw=true "Choose the first window from any group")

You can change this decision later.
