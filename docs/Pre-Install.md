# Pre-install instructions:

* **Windows 10 users** should download the normal `SwitchApps.msi` installer.  
:exclamation: Normal version needs to ungroup the Taskbar apps with [the **7+ Taskbar Tweaker**](https://rammichael.com/7-taskbar-tweaker) or any other solution. More info at [Post-install instructions](https://github.com/dima-iholkin/SwitchApps/blob/dev_24_dotnet-installer/docs/Post-Install.md).  
:exclamation: **If the user is unwilling to ungroup the Taskbar apps,** they should download the `SwitchApps_NoUngroupMod.msi` installer. This mod always chooses the first app from the app group.  

* **Windows 11 users** seem not able to ungroup the Taskbar apps, so should download the `SwitchApps_NoUngroupMod.msi` installer. This mod always chooses the first app from the app group.  

No worries, you can always install another version later.
