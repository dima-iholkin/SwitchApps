# Post-install instructions:

1. Unpin every app from the Taskbar.  
Take a screenshot of the taskbar Pins or write them down, in case you'd want to restore them later.

2. [Install the **7+ Taskbar Tweaker**](https://rammichael.com/7-taskbar-tweaker) and turn on the **Don't group apps** option.  
The app seems not available for Windows 11 as of now (November 2021) and may never be. If you find another way to ungroup apps on Windows 11 - it will probably work as well.

The Windows 10 and 11 behavior we want to avoid:

3. Please restart your computer for the important UX changes to apply.  
Don't worry, these changes will be reverted after an uninstall and reboot.

4. After the restart, try pressing `Alt + Tab` and `Alt + Shift + Tab`.

## Warning:

A. With some very rapid key presses, there is a possibility that the utility will pass an `Enter` keypress to the focused app, which may lead to some undesirable result.

B. The same can happen when the CPU is under high load, or when the utility is in a cold memory state.

C. Some games and especially the full screen game mode doesn't seem to work well with the utility. You can stop the utility during the gameplay.

D. Microsoft Edge on Windows 11 doesn't seem to work with the utility. So the `Alt + Tab` press there triggers the standard Windows 11 `Alt + Tab` behavior.
