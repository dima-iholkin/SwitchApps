# Post-install instructions:

1. Unpin every app from the Taskbar. Make a screenshot of the taskbar in case you want to restore it later.

2. Install **7+ Taskbar Tweaker** and turn on the "Don't group" apps option. It may not be available for Windows 11 users.

3. Please restart your computer for the important UX changes to apply.

4. After the restart, try pressing `Alt + Tab` and `Alt + Shift + Tab`.

## Warning:
A. With some very rapid key presses, there is a possibility that the utility will pass an `Enter` keypress to the focused app, which may lead to some undesirable result.

B. The same can happen when the CPU is under high load, or when the utility is in a cold state in memory.
