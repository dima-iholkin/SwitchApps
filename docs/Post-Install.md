# Post-install instructions:

1. Unpin every app from the Taskbar. Make a screenshot of the taskbar in case you want to restore it later.

2. Install **7 Taskbar Tweaker+** and turn on the "Ungroup apps" option, it may not work for Windows 11 users.

3. Please restart your computer for the important UX changes to apply.

## Warning:
A. With some very rapid key presses, there is a possibility that the utility will pass an `Enter` keypress to the focused app, which may lead to something undesirable.

B. The same can happen when the CPU is under high load, or when the utility is in cold state.
